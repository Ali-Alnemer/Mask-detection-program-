# Mask-detection-program-

In this project, I designed a python program that uses a convolutional neural network to identify whether a person is wearing a mask or not using a camera. Then I will connect the program with the Arduino, which will represent the control unit in a gate, and if the person wears a mask, the gate will open, and if he does not wear a mask, it will be closed. The steps I took to complete the program are as follows.
### 1- Data set collecting
### 2- Data filtering
### 3- Image processing and labelling
### 4- Model training
### 5- Life cam and prediction
### 6- Arduino and hardware connection
